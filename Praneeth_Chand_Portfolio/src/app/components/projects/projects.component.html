      <h3>Smart Drone for Precision Agriculture</h3>
      <p>
        A real-time drone-based monitoring system designed for precision farming. This project used advanced image processing techniques to detect plant diseases in large fields and automatically trigger pesticide spraying. Deployed and tested in actual agricultural environments, it improved crop health monitoring and increased productivity by 40%.

      <h3>Blind With Benefits â€“ IBM Hackathon Finalist</h3>
      <p>
        Built a user-friendly, audio-based application that allows visually impaired users to listen to books, newspapers, and articles in any language. The app uses OCR to detect text from images, translates it, and uses a TTS engine for playback. The solution enhances accessibility for visually impaired communities and was recognized among the top projects at IBM Hackathon (2nd place out of 122).
